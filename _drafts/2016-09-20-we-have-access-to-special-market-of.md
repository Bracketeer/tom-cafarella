<div style="text-align: center;">*<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">We spend hours each day prospecting for sellers, but most would rather sell to traditional buyers than investors. Here’s how you can get access to our database of these buyers.*

<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">As real estate investors, we spend countless hours prospecting for sellers, making offers, and hoping they accept. Most of the time, they don’t because their properties are in good condition and more suited for a traditional home buyer. 

After the seller politely rejects the offer, they will typically say something to the effect of,** “If you can find us a buyer that’s willing to pay close to market value, we will sell. Otherwise, we’re staying put.” ** 

Over the past few years, we’ve accumulated a massive database of these sellers and, as of today, that list is over 1,300 strong. These are sellers that are willing to sell, just not to investors like us. 

<div class="quote-box"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-left">“ 
<div class="quote-text"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The benefits of an off-market property are many.    <span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">

So, as of today, we will be giving out access to this database of properties, and **we are looking to develop relationships with some agents who we can trust that may have some traditional buyers that are interested in these specific properties.** 

The benefits of an off-market property for your buyers are huge. First off, inventory is tight. With our off-market property program, we will have additional options for buyers to see. They will no longer have to wait to get into a huge bidding war, which a majority of buyers are seeing right now. 

## Your buyers, on the other hand, will be some of the few that get into these properties, and will likely be able to get a better deal. If you’re interested in having access to these properties, visit our **[website here](http://cameronaffiliate.com/)** and fill out the form. We will be in touch after you submit the form to get you access to these homes. 

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you. ons for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
