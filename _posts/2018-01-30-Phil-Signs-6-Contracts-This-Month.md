On the call, Phil Castillo, who works with Tom in his Boston office, talks about his super-successful month where he got six properties under contract. Phil has been with Tom’s team for one year now and on the call we go back to his first days on the team (and specifically what some of his struggles were on day one), what the turning point was for him, and the advice that he would give to anyone going on face-to-face seller appointments today. 

We also talk to Barbara, who is also on Tom’s team in Boston, and discuss an investment deal that she put under contract this week for $10,000 less than Tom’s original offer price.
