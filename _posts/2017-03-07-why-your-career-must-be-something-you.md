When it comes to your career, you must love what you do. Why?

To give you some insight, let me tell you about how I got into the real estate industry. **Growing up, my grandfather was a very successful landlord, and I knew from a very young age that I wanted to be a real estate investor as well.** The funny thing is, even though he was financially successful, everyone discouraged me from following in his footsteps. They advised me instead to get a more traditional nine-to-five job in terms of my own career path.

I ended up taking their advice and becoming an accountant. I started as a CPA working at a CPA firm, but I knew from day one that job was a mistake. Because everyone kept pushing me, though, I kept plugging along. Every day I’d sit at my desk and read and daydream about real estate investing. It got to a point where I was having trouble completing my assignments at the firm, and they eventually fired me.

Nobody likes to be fired, and at that time I didn’t know what a blessing it was. For the next two or three weeks, I didn’t know what I was going to do. Then, it hit me—I knew I should follow my passion and give real estate investing a try. The rest is history.

Now I wake up every single day loving going to work and putting in hours. The bottom line is this: If you’re not happy with the work that you do, you’re never going to be great at it. When it comes to making money, you only make a lot of it if you’re really good at what you do. You’ll only be really good at what you do if you’re passionate about it.

Don’t be like me and wait until you get fired to follow your passion. We’re only around for a limited period of time, so get started today and be happy about waking up and going to work.
