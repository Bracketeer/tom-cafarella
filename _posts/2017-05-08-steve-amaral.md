**When did you join Cameron Real Estate Group?**

*January 3rd, 2017.*

**Where did you work before coming to Cameron?**

*I used to own two RE/MAXs and I also worked at Keller Williams and I’ve had my own brokerages.*

**What was life/business like before making the decision to work with Cameron? What were you up to, how was it different?**

*I would say more hectic, out of control, not focused.*

**Were you unsure and/or skeptical before deciding to work at Cameron? What were you unsure about?**

*They made some pretty big promises so I thought they were blowing smoke. They recruited me for over a year and I just didn’t believe their pitch but they’ve actually over-produced **from what they told me they were going to do.*

**What was it specifically that ultimately helped you make the decision to join Cameron?**

*Well once I met with Nicole and I met with Tom I felt a little more comfortable with what they were telling me. They showed me some of systems that they were using. And like I said, they’ve done more than they said they were going to do, and I expected a lot less to be honest with you.*
##
**What benefits have you received since making the decision to work with Tom? How is life or business different?**

*My appointments have been scheduled for me. I’ve already put under agreement in the first four months more commissions than I made all of last year, strictly through Tom, not even my own business.*

**Tom always tells everyone he has tons of leads and most agents think it is too good to be true. What would you say about that?**

*I hope none of them believe him because I’ll take all the leads that they don’t get.*

**What would you say to someone who is on the fence about choosing to join Cameron?**

*I wished I’d joined a year and a half ago. I am also a broker in Massachusetts and New Hampshire so I don’t need to work with an office or an agency, I can run my own business. And with Tom, what he’s offering, it’s really a no-brainer, there’s no reason for me to work for myself. Tom’s been incredible with his resources and he takes advice and he runs with it. I‘d say he’s the best owner I’ve ever worked with. Including myself, I’m not as good as Tom, I said it!*
