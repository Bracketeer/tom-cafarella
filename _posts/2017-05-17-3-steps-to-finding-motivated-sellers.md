Cold calling is the tried and true method for finding motivated sellers. It's not the most fun thing in the world, but it flat-out works. However, there are few things you need to keep in mind to cold call effectively, or you might end up giving up far too easily.

**First, make sure that you load your phone records into a dialer when calling.** We recommend a dialer called **Mojo Dialer**. For $150 a month, you can make between 500 and 700 calls per day. The benefit of this kind of software is that it prevents wasting time; you dial from one person to the next with no pause. If it goes to voicemail, you just click a button to leave a message rather than saying the same thing over and over again.

**The second important thing to be sure of is that you're dialing the right people.** You want to call motivated sellers that make sense to call. Two groups that I like are people in a notice of default situation or absentee owners that don't live at the house in question.

The next most important aspect is to make sure you have the right phone numbers. You also need to get cell phone records. **Home records work, but cell phone records will get calls picked up three times more on average.** With good phone numbers, you'll get a higher contact rate. A good contact rate to shoot for is 10%, meaning you actually talk to 10% of all the people that you dial. A contact rate of 3% means you don't have good phone numbers.

With a dialer and good phone numbers, you'll find that cold calling is a very useful way to generate motivated sellers.
