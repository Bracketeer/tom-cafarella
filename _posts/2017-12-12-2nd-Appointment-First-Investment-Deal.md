Joining me on the call is Kathryn Acari, who landed her first investment deal since working our leads.  On the call we discuss the specifics of the appointment, the negotiations and ultimately how she put her first deal together.  Also on the call is Barbara who also secured an investment deal this week.  

Then, we will open the floor to the rest of the group. You will be able to give us the play by play of what happened on your face to face appointment, and then we will give you feedback on different techniques to use in order to turn the appointment into cold, hard, cash.

If you have gone on a seller appointment this week, please come prepared to talk about it. The more feedback that you are able to get on your face to face appointments, the more money you will put in your pocket.
