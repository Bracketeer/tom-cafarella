 Today, I’d like to share the most important thing there is to know when it comes to real estate investing, which is how to get a super low offer accepted. 
 
I know what you’re thinking: The market is too hot right now, sellers want too much for their properties, and too many investors are competing over too few deals. Nevertheless, I’m going to tell you exactly how my team and I get over 100 investment deals accepted every single year, using super low offers. 
 
I remember the very first deal I got under contract with a super low offer. It was nearly 10 years ago, but I still vividly remember the feeling of disbelief I had after having that offer accepted. It wasn’t until I actually closed on that deal that it was ever going to happen. 
 
I made $115,000 on a wholesale deal thanks to a super low offer. It was a great feeling to get such an amazing deal. Actually, this deal is what launched my real estate investing career. 
 
At the end of the day, **getting super low offers accepted doesn’t take the skills of a master negotiator.** My team doesn’t get great deals by being master negotiators; we get offers accepted based on statistics and having great volume. 
 
Moving forward, something you must know is that 10% of the population is going to want to sell to an investor. No matter what you do when you’re face to face with a seller, only 10% of sellers will want to sell to an investor. 
 
So when you’re dealing with sellers, make sure they understand the benefits and drawbacks of selling to an investor. When my team and I go on a face-to-face appointment, we go over all of this. For those of you who don’t know, **we buy in cash with no mortgage contingency, no formal inspection, and we close on the seller’s time frame.**
 
One of the misconceptions about buying properties at a discount is that sellers will want to sell in seven, 10, or 14 days. Actually, the process can turn into somewhat of a waiting game. I’ve personally waited on a seller who had an 18-month time frame. But it was because of my team’s patience that we won the deal. 
 
**Being willing to work with a seller’s time frame will be massively important to your success as an investor.**
 
Even so, it’s still true that only 10% of sellers will want to make a deal with an investor. With that being said, you’re probably wondering how my team and I manage to do 100 deals a year. The secret to how we get 100 deals a year is that we get in front of 1,000 sellers a year. 
 
At the end of the day, this is a lead generation game. In order to set up 1,000 face-to-face appointments per year, **we have systems in place to help us book a minimum of 20 face-to-face appointments per week.**

Don’t push the seller to make a deal with you. Instead, do what is in their best interest. Give them all of the options and make sure they make the decision that’s right for them. 10% of the time, their best option will be to accept a discounted offer from you. 
 
And, because my team and I are partnering with investors across the country, the systems we use are available to you regardless of the market you’re in. We’re taking our lead generation systems and putting them in other geographic markets across the United States.
