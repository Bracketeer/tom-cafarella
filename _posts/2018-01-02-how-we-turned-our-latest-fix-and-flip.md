Welcome to one of our latest fix-and-flip properties at 21 Center Avenue in Reading, Massachusetts!

This property was purchased three months ago for $305,000. We put in $60,000 worth of repairs, and we just recently got the project under contract for $500,000. All told, we’re probably looking at a $50,000 to $70,000 net profit. 

Follow along in the video above to get a full tour of this property and hear me explain some of the fix-and-flip processes we used to turn this house into a profit. **For your convenience, I’ve included timestamps below so you can skip ahead to certain sections that might interest you:**
