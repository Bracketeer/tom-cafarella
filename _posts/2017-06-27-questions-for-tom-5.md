**00:01:25** If you are thinking of spending time or money in order to generate additional leads above and beyond the leads, we are generating for you please run it by me first… I can help decipher if the program is worth it and/or how to make it work even better for you 

**00:03:01** An example of one of these scenarios regarding marketing directly to vacant properties and why I don’t think it will work… 

**00:10:26** Difficult buyer leads… how to properly work them and reach the client…Internet buyer leads that are organized by Coldwell Banker International Internet team, I’ve closed many but it’s a lot of work to find good clients; 35% referral fee upon closing 

**00:14:22** I have several single family rentals and I am setting up an LLC for holding. Any recommendations for a good insurance company? 

**00:15:52** In regards to tracking the multiple flip projects and closings, do you use a specialized software or is it all an excel spreadsheet somewhere? 

**00:17:48** What numbers do you use to determine if it is a good rental property? 

**00:25:23** Where is the best place to find General Contractors? 

**00:28:27** I am looking for my first deal, the property is a new home built in 2008 and was constructed 75% complete all the way up to sheetrock mudded and cabinets and trim installed. But has been vandalized and all copper ripped out of the walls, meaning the house will need to be rewired, sheetrocked and flooring completed. The owner does not have the property up for sale at this time, I thought about mailing an offer on the property. Does this sound like a feasible deal? 

**00:31:48** How many leads do you get from organic searches to your site from Google? 

**00:38:25** Once I have a contract with a seller for the wholesale, exactly what are the steps/contracts/attorney needed at what times for the buyer to sign their own contract to buy the property and how do the seller and myself get paid by the buyer? 

**00:50:11** When I reach out to my leads a number say they already have an offer on the table they want to take but they are willing for me to make an offer as well. What is our best course of action in this case without wasting a lot of time?
