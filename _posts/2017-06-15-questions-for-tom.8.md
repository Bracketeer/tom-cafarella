**00:00:30** Tom is adding a brief 20-30 minute live session every single day at 4pm, Monday through Friday in case you have questions on a daily basis starting Wednesday, June 21st.

**00:03:15** In the 10 week agreement what does it mean every listing that is taken 100% your profit to keep?

**00:04:07** Quite a few wholesalers that I know locally (in St. Louis) have success selling rental properties to out of state buyers, especially on the west coast (I suppose due to our lower housing cost). What is the best way to build an out of state buyers list for this purpose?

**00:09:33** I have a property that has issues from a single family residence view but it’s on one and a half acres sits on a busy corner that could be great in a commercial sense. There is an established muffler/tire store across the street. Developing this would take time I can’t do it is my only viable option to try and wholesale if I get it under contract and advertise it as such?

**00:11:57** In addition to following up with the leads I’m calling equity owners, what is the best way to start the call to grab their attention right away?

**00:17:55** When working leads it is always a funneling process…

**00:19:18** There are some beginning signs in my immediate market and some surrounding cities that the market is slowing and slightly retreating. Definitely more in the range above the median price wholesaling should still work with less risk even quick cosmetic fix and flips below the median price. Anything we should look out for that the market might be at a top. Will it be easier to find leads once we top? Do we have to be more careful?

**00:24:05** Once I am a licensed agent what’s the best way to handle disclosures in direct mail, websites etc. What are some key phrases to use to stress that I am an investor but also can list if selling direct isn’t for them?

**00:25:34** I’m not a real estate agent, I’m not confident I can even fill out a Purchase & Sales agreement in the event I’m even able to make that offer. Secondly, I was told that when I write a check to the seller I should actually have it down via an escrow company. I didn’t see anything like that when I was in the training videos, am I missing something or am I making this too complicated?

**00:30:48** Follow up to the above question, In the event that I want to list the property should I find a local real estate agent?

**00:31:48** How can you buy a property that would be great for a fix and flip when it is bank owned, but nobody seems to know anything about said property?

**00:33:34** What do you say to a lead that says “Sure, I’ll sell my house for $2,000,000” when the house is worth about $500,000?
 
**00:35:44** If you get a lead that has told our inside staff they are working with a real estate agent in the sale of their home. Do you still call the customer even though they have already advised us on what they are doing? Are these good leads?

**00:38:15** Are there any circumstances where you ask for an inspection when submitting a contract? Do most investors just roll the dice and take a chance without inspections?

**00:41:07** If a seller is non-responsive but the opportunity looks to be really good in that the mortgage is close to zero and the seller has owned the property for over 10 years, could I go and just knock on the door?

**00:42:13** If a real estate broker says, If I find you a buyer how much will you give me? What do you say and how much would you give?

**00:44:12** Tips/critiques when dealing with a lead that provided a bad number but responded via e-mail?

**00:46:52** Follow Up Boss question… I am communication via e-mail with a couple of leads trying to get them on the phone or to book an appointment. Is it recommended to leave the automation plans in place until an appointment takes place?

**00:48:13** When wholesaling a deal to an interested buyer wants property address for him to run comps and info on MLS do we give that info away before the contract is signed?

**00:50:45** Talked to an agent yesterday who said they would give me some kickback if I let them list the property, what should I ask for?

**00:51:23** I’m getting better with FUB but not an expert could we maybe have a webinar on using FUB better?

**00:53:37** Made an offer of $500 seller counted at $515k. The house will retail at $565k to $570k; no repairs needed. The seller would like to lease the property back for a year from the new owners otherwise he won’t sell. Any advice on how to proceed?
