Joining me on the call is Diana and Chris Jones, who have both been working with us for a little over a week. One the call we analyze two of their seller appointments that they went on in the last week and why knowing the seller’s mortgage balance is so critical. We also talk about how to use a net sheet to negotiate a better price with a seller.
