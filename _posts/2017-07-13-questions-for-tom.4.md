**00:02:20** Do you explain to a seller how you come up with an investor offer price?

**00:06:30** A lot of seminar examples I see are homes within a $200k average price, what happens when $700k is the average price, does that change the calculations?

**00:11:20** Any suggestions as to how we can lock down my first investment property? In this low inventory, sellers market, it’s proving to be extremely difficult. I do not want to buy tax liens. Our main objective for right now is to flip.

**00:19:07** Do you have any automated way of texting more people as the number of leads grow?

**00:21:54** I spoke to a seller yesterday; I have a deal from my sphere. ARV is 670k and the seller is willing to take 450k is this a deal?  How do I approach the seller being that they are in my sphere?

**00:34:10**  Is there a 100% hard money lender in Texas?  If so, how do I find them?

**00:38:45** When promoting a wholesale deal,  how do you prevent other investors going behind your back and talking directly to the owner.

**00:41:17** Does the 70% rule get modified if the ARV gets over a certain amount?  Is it ever ok to pay ofr 70% of ARV?

**00:44:10** What would you suggest using as a marketing tool to obtain more motivated seller leads? I’ve been researching and comparing ClickFunnels and OnceCarrot platforms but I’m not sure what would be better?

**00:47:50** I’m new to the real estate investing world. I definitely know that I want to wholesale but I’m wondering if I should get my license to be an agent? I just need help deciding if it would be a good thing to get in my situation.

**00:49:25** I’m licensed and am thinking if my husband should get his real estate license is there any need for him too?  What are the pros and cons?

**00:50:43** I was talking to another investor in St. Louis and they found much of their success in fining homes by sending letters to family members of the deceased. If this is what my competitors are doing, no wonder it seems all of the houses are already taken BEFORE they go vacant. So maybe the vacant house search isn’t a good path for me… thoughts?

**00:55:44**  What lists do you dial to? How should I go about obtaining these lists or phone numbers?

**01:03:15** What’s the best blog or video you recommend for the one with no marketing money?
