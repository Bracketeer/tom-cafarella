I recently visited Robert Whitelaw’s podcast, “Real Estate Realities with the RebelBroker.” We had a great conversation about how I got into real estate, where things are in the market right now (both in Massachusetts and on the West Coast), and where are market is heading. 

One of the things we agreed on is our market is heading for a shift. We discussed a few similarities between the current market and the market before the last downturn, the problem with millennials and student debt, and what signs will show that our market is shifting.

We also discussed a few tips to help you be successful in real estate, such as finding good markets to invest in. 

Check out our full conversation above. If you have any other real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!
