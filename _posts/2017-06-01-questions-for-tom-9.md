**00:02:35** When wholesaling, is It common to have to back out of the contract if you can’t find an investor to assign the contract to?

**00:05:53** Manufactured home. Do you recommend buying manufactured homes?  Are they good leads?

**00:08:23** Do you have scripts for cold calling FSBO, rental owners, pre-foreclosures, etc.?

**00:10:49** We also have partnered with a silent investor. Do you have a silent partnership agreement that you use?

**00:13:08** I know that FUB is tailored toward investment properties, but I’d like to use it for my other real estate leads outside of the program. Are we able to use it or do you want us to use it strictly for program leads?

**00:14:04** We are receiving cold calls with notes that the seller is willing to sell at roughly a Zillow price. What would you say to address the Zillow price and how my offer is more realistic?

**00:15:58** Is the script mentioned above the same script used by your inside sales team when cold calling? 

**00:17:51** When a seller has a reverse mortgage and it’s about to end, does the seller keep the property or the lender? Is it better to short sale or list?

**00:19:04** How is the compensation structured for your agents that work your investment company generated leads – if they list what are splits versus if we end up buying it?

**00:22:01** How do I let someone on the team know when I booked an appointment?

**00:22:52** What is the group e-mail I need to join on Cluster in order to send pictures to you for review?

**00:27:20** What do say to a seller when they tell you that they never filled anything out to be contacted?

**00:35:03** How do I capitalize on leads that are not investment deals because they are too nice?

**00:38:00** Just booked an appointment. Should I send an email to the seller with all of our contact info or am I better off just showing up for the appointment?

**00:40:25** When I get a scheduled phone meeting booked for me by your team should I wait until the scheduled date/time to call them or am I better off trying to get out there as soon as possible?

**00:43:20** When wholesaling, does the end buyer have to be a cash buyer?

**00:47:08** I have a couple of leads for manufactured homes, do we go after these? What if the area is prime but the manufactured home is in really bad shape, what’s your take on this?

**00:51:21** I’ve had some luck with leads in the beginning but seem to have hit a rough patch.  What else can I do to convert better?
