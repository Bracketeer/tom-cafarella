There are three simple things I did to help me double my transactions year over year, which are easy to replicate.

These systems happened by accident and out of necessity for me to work fewer hours. As a brief backstory, I’ll tell you that when my daughter was born, I was working between 80 and 100 hours per week. My wife told me that things had to change.

I wasn’t looking to make more transactions at the time, but rather get myself down to 40 hours per week so that I could spend more time with my daughter. I hired three key people in my real estate business: an inside sales agent to make all of my outbound calls and book appointments, an agent to take all of my appointments, and an administrative assistant for the paperwork and backend compliance matters.

**What I quickly realized was that by leveraging my time and allowing myself to focus on lead generation only, I doubled my transactions year over year.** Because it worked so well, I decided to implement it across my real estate team. Every agent that’s on my team has leads generated for them and gets the backend taken care of by the administrative assistant, allowing them to do what they do best - work with buyers and sellers.

If you want to learn more about working on our team, give me a call or send me a text. I’d really love to hear from you.
