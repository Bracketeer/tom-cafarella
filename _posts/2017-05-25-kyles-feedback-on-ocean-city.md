Kyle had some older leads that were initially non-responsive, Tom Cafarella of Ocean City Development helped him convert those leads by sending a custom designed email blast out to them.

Kyle's Feedback:

Tom, The email went out today and I got 26 responses and 4 phone calls. I have set up several appointments, some will be for listings and there is a few that look like promising assignment leads. I do love this system. I am looking forward to the trip in July.
