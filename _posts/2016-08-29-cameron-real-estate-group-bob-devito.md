*"You know he’s different than most brokers because he’s willing to share his knowledge and he’s not a typical broker in that he doesn’t do deals himself, he’s always looking to help his agents. My experience has been very good, everybody is very helpful, everybody’s out for the best for the company. Tom’s different in that he is very rare in that he does share the knowledge that made him successful with his agents which is something that most people hide from their agents. He actually shares it with them. Cameron is not a traditional real estate company it definitely makes you think outside the box, there’s so many ways to make money besides traditional real estate. To me it’s just you know ten times better than a traditional real estate company."*
