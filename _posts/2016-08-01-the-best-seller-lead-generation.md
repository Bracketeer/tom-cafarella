One question I get asked all the time is, “What is the best seller lead generation strategy in today’s market?” It all boils down to this: **do you want to spend time generating seller leads, or do you want to spend money generating seller leads?**

Let’s assume that you have your marketing budget and you want to spend money on leads, not time. I recommend working with a company called Bold Leads. Bold Leads provides sellers with an online valuation of what their property is worth. The seller will fill out a form, include their email address and home address, and click submit. Then you will get that lead.

These leads run anywhere from $50 to $100 per lead. When someone is looking for an estimate of what their property is worth, generally, there is a fairly high chance that they will be looking to sell in the near future.

**If you don’t want to spend money on leads but you do want to spend time, the best marketing method is door-knocking.** Target exactly who you want to work with. Have your script and handouts ready to go. We have generated a ton of leads with this method in the markets where we want to buy and list property.

If you don’t have money or time to generate seller leads but you still want seller appointments, give me a call or shoot me a text at 781-918-8800. We generate over 100 seller leads each month and send our agents out directly to those appointments.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I would be happy to help you!
