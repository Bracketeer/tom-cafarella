 Jump to 6:25 for the beginning of our conversation.

On this call, we cover:

* Samantha Edwards, an active Cameron agent for two months who spent two weeks working with buyers and then switched to sellers
* The number of hours she puts into prospecting seller leads on MOJO Dailer with a 15-hour prospecting goal
* One face-to-face listing appointment for every four hours of calls
* A seller lead in the archives who already sold his property. One conversation revealed that he was looking for a partner so he could reinvest the money he netted from his property sale
* What makes Cameron/Ocean City Development different as a partner
* Using an educational video and offering a follow-up call with Tom to move the conversation forward and convert the seller lead into a private lender
