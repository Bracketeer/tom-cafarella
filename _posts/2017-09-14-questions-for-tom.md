**00:01:01** Tell me a little bit about your first deal?

**00:01:10** I screened this lead pretty well. I always ask “what amount of money would make you move?”

**00:02:59** Got it under contract for $20k and with repairs will be all in at $35k

**00:03:54** Since it’s in a college town how difficult would it be to get two college kids to rent it for $500 each a month?

**00:04:12** What are your plans for this property?

**00:06:38** Could you rent the property in its current condition?

**00:07:05** How many leads do you think you’ve gotten so far?

**00:07:27** What does your direct mail campaign look like right now?

**00:08:45** How many face to faces have you gotten so far with our leads?

**00:09:48** How many weeks has it been so far?

**00:10:44** If you were to flip the first property we discussed what do you think you’d make?

**00:12:04** Something we do, which you can do once licensed, when thinking of fixing and flipping we’ll close on it and just put it on the property. And in a lot of cases we’re getting the same as if we did the actual renovation.

**00:13:16** Do you feel like you’re able to keep up with a lot of the leads?

**00:14:19** How many deals do you think you need to do to give up your full-time job?

**00:24:04** Working a multi-family deal and want to get your opinion to make sure I’ve got my head around it…

**00:39:25** What is the magic number rent x 1%?
