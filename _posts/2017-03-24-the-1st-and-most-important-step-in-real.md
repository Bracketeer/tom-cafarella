If you want to become a real estate investor, the first step is the most important one in the process. It's the only one that matters.

**The first step is to get one-on-one with motivated sellers to make them offers.**

In today's market, once a property goes online and you have 10 to 20 investors competing for it, you won't get a great deal on it anymore. In fact, there are people out there doing deals for little to no margins at all. As a real estate investor, you don't want to compete against that.

You want to create your own leads and your own deals that you're the only one in on.

That's why I'd caution you not to run out and get a website or business cards and stationery or any of the little things that won't put any money in your pocket. Sellers don't care about your business cards! Don't do all the small things like buying business cards or reading yet another real estate investing book because you might not ever get an appointment or a deal.

The bottom line is to make getting the appointment your No. 1 priority. **Once you get one-on-one with enough sellers, it almost doesn't matter whether you have a nice website and brochureâ€”you will make money.**
