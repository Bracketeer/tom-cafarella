**Did everything go smoothly when you worked with Ocean City Development?**

*"Yes, and I worked with Katie Blair I believe her name was, she was the Realtor that I originally dealt with and she was fantastic, I mean terrific, professional but compassionate.  Very nice person, and Tom was very nice. Every time I called him and left him a message he’d call me right back."*

**What was the main reason that you decided to sell to Ocean City Development?**

*"The reason I sold to Ocean was, I only had two, I had once come up and we couldn’t agree on price. And Ocean City came, they gave me a price, I thought it was a fair price for the condition of the house and I went with Ocean City. And I had no idea of how they were going to be to deal with but they were fantastic, I had no problems."*

**Do you feel like your were treated fairly and they were helpful throughout the entire process?**

*"Yes they were."*

**In the end, were you happy that you ended up selling to them and would you recommend another seller in a similar situation do the same?**

*"I definitely would, they were very fair with me."*
