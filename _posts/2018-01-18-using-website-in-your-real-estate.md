Today we’re going to talk about how you can and should use a website in your real estate investing business. The reality is that getting a website on day one doesn’t make sense for a lot of people. I’m here to talk about what a website should be doing for you in your business when you’re ready for it. 
 
**Here’s an outline of what I discussed, so you can skip ahead to the part in the video that interests you most:**
 
0:50- The only reason you need a website in the real estate business.
 
1:45- How to drive traffic to your website once you’re ready to have it.
 
3:00- What not to do when building your website.
 
5:35- An example of a website that successfully converts leads.
 
6:45- What you should absolutely do when building your website.
 
7:35- How I doubled my leads from my website by using Investor Carrot.
 
8:30- How you can learn from my mistakes in developing your real estate investor business 
by becoming a true partner.
 
9:30- How to find out that working with us in your market will look like.
 
If you’re interested in becoming a partner, or you just have any questions about your website, lead conversion, or anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out to me at [www.realestateinvestingiseasy.com](www.realestateinvestingiseasy.com). I’ll make sure you get free access to all of my in-person training events that are held each month. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
