Welcome to our real estate video blog. This channel is dedicated to helping you make more money in your real estate career and business.

We’re going to give you a *behind-the-scenes look* at the systems in my business that allow me to generate more than 1,000 leads a month, fix and flip more than 50 properties a year, and that also allow my agents to double their commissions in the course of one year.

We’re also going to take a look at the real estate economy, especially where we are and where we will be, as well as the *impending market shift*.

I’ve condensed each video down to the vital information that you need to help you grow your real estate business. If you ever want a more in-depth look at our videos, check out [www.TomCafarella.com](www.TomCafarella.com) or reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!
