**00:03:48** Can you find 100% hard money in Orlando, Fl?

**00:10:38** Is the API in our FUB settings unique to myself or is it generic to the whole enterprise account? I’m trying to integrate a dialer that allows me to save/send a lead to FUB once I talk to them and determine they are someone to follow up with.

**00:11:52** In FUB, when you create an appointment it shows the owner/seller as an invitee. FUB doesn’t e-mail the owner/seller the apt info does it?

**00:13:13** California…are you offering on CAR contracts or FirstTuesday contracts?

**00:14:15** What happened with my trip to Nebraska…

**00:15:34** Jeff Cohn out of Omaha, Nebraska – I went flew out there and visited with him on Monday and Tuesday and he walked me through all of the systems in his brokerage

**00:15:56** Jeff is mainly a real estate broker who does a little bit of flipping (which is the opposite of what I do). The reason behind the trip was to gain is to see the best practices for somebody that has a very successful brokerage

**00:16:20** The number one thing he does differently than me is that he had numbers for everything. Etc. how many calls it takes to get a deal… it takes 125 calls for every deal that he does (tracked over 5 years)

**00:18:50** A question came in from Mike: I have a potential deal that would involved splitting the lot. The city indicated it doesn’t take a long time. What are some other things I can ask regarding the lot split?

**00:23:30** Jeff uses team leaders within the company to help manage the newer people

**00:26:45** Do you have any statistics on the percentage of leads being sent out to your group that are more of a retail sale vs investor property? It seems all of the leads are retail sales that I am receiving.

**00:29:07** Is there a tutorial that goes through just the most common tasks we use for FUB?

**00:31:26** Do you have any idea the percentage of people in our group that are real estate agents vs investors only?

**00:34:20** Are others seeing the 70% formula moving more to 75% or 80%
