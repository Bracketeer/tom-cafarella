**What was life/business like before making the decision to work with Tom’s team?**

*"A little less busy, but none the less, I didn’t know this opportunity existed, to be honest."*

**Were you unsure and/or skeptical before deciding to work with Tom? If so, what were you unsure about?**

*"Well I definitely was unsure and a little skeptical because I’ve made deals in marketing and other types of things that have really messed me over and so that kind of was the initial insecurity. But when I got to talking to Tom and just him as a person kind of being in the same position as I am it really helped me to make that decision."*

**What was it specifically that ultimately helped you make the decision to go ahead and work with our team?**

*"Well, Tom was pretty open, and he really showed me that this is something that he’s going to help me out with and he’s proven that."*

**How long did it take you to put your first investment deal under contract after working with Tom?**

*"2 weeks."*

**How many seller leads would you estimate that you have received since working with Tom?**

*"Oh probably about 50."*

**What would you say to someone who is on the fence about choosing to work with Tom and his team?**

*"I think it’s a great opportunity. If you’ve never been involved in real estate investing than working with Tom really helps you to have the materials you need to get ready for that."*
