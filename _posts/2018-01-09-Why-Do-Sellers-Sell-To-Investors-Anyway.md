If you've never done an investment deal before, it can sometimes be hard to believe that anyone would WANT to take less than market value for their home.  On the later part of the call, we discuss all of the major reasons why sellers sell to us at a discount.  In the beginning part of the call, we discuss how to get all family members on the same page in order to get a contract signed.  

Then, we will open the floor to the rest of the group. You will be able to give us the play by play of what happened on your face to face appointment, and then we will give you feedback on different techniques to use in order to turn the appointment into cold, hard, cash.

If you have gone on a seller appointment this week, please come prepared to talk about it. The more feedback that you are able to get on your face to face appointments, the more money you will put in your pocket.

Learn how to create an unlimited supply of face to face appointments at: [www.getmotivatedsellerappointments.com](www.getmotivatedsellerappointments.com).
