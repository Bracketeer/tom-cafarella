<div style="text-align: center;">*<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Setting an appointment with a motivated seller is important. However, the next step will determine your results.*

<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">In my **[last video](http://www.tomcafarella.com/2017/03/the-1st-and-most-important-step-in-real.html)**, I stressed the importance of generating motivated seller appointments. Once you’ve generated that appointment, you’re 90% of the way there. 

Now you’ve actually got to go on the appointment<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> and do everything in your power to have the best one possible. Most investors think the most important part is the pre-appointment analysis and prep in figuring out what your offer is going to be. That couldn’t be further from the truth. 
<b> 
The most important thing when it comes to having a successful seller appointment is building a great rapport with the seller and providing them with solutions to their needs. </b>What you’re offering is irrelevant. You need to go to the appointment, get the seller to like you, and build a bond with them. It’s not much more complicated than that. You want to understand what they need and how you can provide them with a solution that meets those needs. 
<div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Understanding their needs will help you provide a solution. <span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">In a lot of cases, you might not be the correct solution for that seller. Your job is to help the seller determine what the right solution is and help them get there. **That’s what will make you a ton of money in this business.**
