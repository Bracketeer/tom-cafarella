<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you followed steps one and two of the most important things to do in order to make money as a real estate investor, you’ve generated motivated seller leads and gone on appointments with a seller. You’ve built a rapport with them, and now they want to work with you. 

The only thing left to figure out is how you will personally make money on that deal. There are 4 ways to do so: 

## 1. Fix and flip: Fixing and flipping a property <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">generally provides the highest profit of all four exit strategies. You’ll want to cherry pick which deals you want to do and which deals you don’t want to do. 
## 
<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">**2. Wholesale:** These will be the deals that, for whatever reason, you don’t want to fix and flip. There’s never been a better market than today to wholesale a property. Investors are out there fighting amongst themselves and competing over deals with each other. One of the best methods to wholesale is to go to your local auction with a flyer of the property you’re trying to sell and hand it out. Anyone attending an auction is highly motivated to buy a property, and this is one of the best ways to build a cash buyer list.

Buy and hold: **By this I mean add that property into your rental property portfolio. 

<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">**4. List the property:** If you’re a licensed agent, you can do this yourself. If not, you can reach out to another agent. Why would I recommend that someone list their property? Let’s say you have a property worth $200,000 in its current condition, the seller for it owes $180,000, and your investment offer was $150,000. This deal fits into the niche of not being a good enough price to be an acquisition and not being a short sale option because the seller has equity built into it. At the end of the day, it can only be a listing deal.
