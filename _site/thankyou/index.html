		            <p class="testimonial">Tom , it has been awesome working with you, learning something new everyday. My life before working with you was boring, frustrating, and trying to get started in a new market is very difficult. Now I have plenty of leads, and I have support to call if I need it!! I was very unsure and very skeptical about working with you, the only thing I new was that you were from Massachusetts and that is where I am from, and I was trying figure out if you were the Real Deal. What helped me decide to join you was checking out your real estate website and calling one of your agents and asking her all about you, and what she thought of your company, and she said you were the Real Deal!!! The benefits of joining you are that I have purpose to get up, get dressed and get moving everyday!! My life and business are better for it, I have been with you just over a month and half, I have 2 listed and 2 under contract :) I have investors wanting to work with me. I would recommend anyone that is willing work and wants to learn more about how you do business, and if anyone is on the fence about joining you, have them call me. I will tell you Tom is the Real Deal, and whatever he says he is going to do, he does it. Man of his word!!!</p>

Heâs pretty awesome, I like working with him. On his team, Iâve tripled my business a lot due to just some of the flexibility heâs given me. My commission is higher and heâs actually allowed me to start my own team down in Florida so heâs been absolutely phenomenal. A mentor, a trainer, and a great broker in general. Very good at answering questions. He allows us flexibility, he really wants to see us grow. He gives us leads, no other office is going to give you leads. These are actual appointments that you walk out on and thereâs a seller who wants to sell their house. Iâll say that he also likes encouraging entrepreneurs which I think is very important, especially in the economical state of America. So itâs good for him to be supporting everyone like that. Not just Realtors but everyone in the real estate business. Iâm very, very happy working for him and Iâm very thankful for the opportunity that I have to build my team through him.</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">What he says, what he promises, he delivers. I think he has a totally unusual and new concept for real estate agents. And I think that at this point where you have a lot going on with technology itâs very difficult, unless youâre in a big team, to do well. The way he has the office designed is he has the resources to help you compete with some of those mega teams. Itâs been phenomenal, Iâve done extremely well. Iâve had my license for 30 years so Iâve been with some of the major real estate companies. My last place was Keller Williams. I was there for three years, and although they have really good training and resources they actually donât help you generate leads. They give you ideas and they have theories. Whatâs great about being at Cameron Real Estate is, they actually just give you leads. You know they help you with the follow up, they help you be competitive. So itâs been a good experience. A lot of these big major companies, their systems are not keeping up with technology and I think that Tom is very forward thinking. I personally have developed, I work my own niche, and heâs been able to help me with that, to develop that and to generate my own leads. So Iâm not just relying on leads from Zillow or Trulia or any of those other major search engines, which can be very expensive.</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">Tom is like easy going and available for, you know, information, questions, and guidance. Itâs fabulous, itâs like the best thing that ever happened to my career. And Iâm not exaggerating. One thing thatâs different is that he, often at other brokerages they say that the owner and/or managing broker isnât taking listings but really they are, and he is not. He does not work as a sales broker. So thereâs never anything that would happen, you know, like the boss gets all the good stuff because he does not do any sales as the listing agent or the buying agent. He never does any of that. So thatâs not a conflict. It often happens at other brokerages. The other thing I might say about working with Tom, with the company, but with Tom specifically at the company is that heâs just 100% on top of every newest technology and available service. So agents get service, you can get phone calls. Everyone knows that leads are called and appointments are scheduled but also there are mailers, thereâs concierge, thereâs a la carte services, thereâs staging, photography, phone calling, after sales follow up mailers. You donât see that with any other companies. Itâs all provided opportunity, and Iâm not saying itâs free, but even when itâs not free itâs like at cost. Heâs not profiting off it. You donât see that at other companies.</p>
