When did you join Cameron Real Estate Group?

January of this year. [2017]

Where did you work before coming to Cameron?

Keller Williams.

What was life/business like before making the decision to work with Cameron? What were you up to, how was it different?

Slow to non-existent. I didn’t do any business while I was at Keller Williams.

Were you unsure and/or skeptical before deciding to work at Cameron? What were you unsure about?

I wasn’t really unsure. I was on a team at Keller Williams and the team that I was on decided to come over. They’re all kind of veteran agents and I knew that if they were coming over it was going to be a good choice for me to do. So I didn’t have any hesitation about going.

What was it specifically that ultimately helped you make the decision to join Cameron?

That they would provide leads. That was a huge thing for me, being new in the business. I didn’t get that kind of support when I was with Keller Williams and when I found out that they had offered an endless supply of leads it was a no-brainer to go there.

What benefits have you received since making the decision to work with Tom? How is life or business different?

The benefits of working, it’s definitely the leads I’ve gotten. I’ve gotten a ton of buyers, I’m constantly busy now. Also they offered me a position as a buyer nurturer so I actually get all the leads in and I get to hand pick the ones that I want so it’s been fantastic. They provide me with all the tools I need, it’s perfect.

Tom always tells everyone he has tons of leads and most agents think it is too good to be true. What would you say about that?

It is completely true. I myself get between 40 and 60 leads a day and what you do with them is really your own business. I can attest that they have nothing but leads. I cannot be bored working at Cameron at all.

What would you say to someone who is on the fence about choosing to join Cameron?

Especially if you’re a new agent you have to join Cameron, they give you all the support that you need. Everyone is fantastic, everyone helps each other out. They give you every opportunity to be a successful agent. Their goal is really to get you up and running. They want you to have your own leads and do your own business but they are going to give you everything you need to get up to where you need to be. her out. They give you every opportunity to be a successful agent. Their goal is really to get you up and running. They want you to have your own leads and do your own business but they are going to give you everything you need to get up to where you need to be.

        <title>Zillow Instant Offers: How It Will Impact Local Real Estate Investors</title>
        <link>localhost:4000/zillow-instant-offers-how-it-will.html</link>

        <description>
I’ve been flooded with questions about Zillow “Instant Offers” and so I wanted to address it formally with everyone.

Yesterday Zillow announced ‘Instant Offers’ where off-market sellers can put their homes on Zillow and receive offers without agents who don’t work for them.

When a seller clicks on the “Get offer” button, their information will be sent out to 15 investors and those investors will have the option to offer on the property.

The seller will then have the opportunity to accept or reject the offer.

From the limited information they have released, it looks like the investors will be large institutional investors(Wall Street) and not local area investors.

Right now they are running the test in two markets: Las Vegas and Orlando.

If they like the results they are going to consider adding additional markets.

If not, they may just kill the idea altogether.

My opinion on this:


  Right now, it isn’t really something to think much about.  Even if it gains traction it won’t be an overnight thing so as of today it is business as usual.
  Most sellers want to do business face to face when they sell a home.  Their house is typically their biggest asset and at least in the beginning, I think most sellers are going to be nervous about getting “scammed” selling their house online until it becomes mainstream(if it ever does).  I think there is a good chance that many sellers may get that quote online(just like they look at the Zestimate) and then call someone local who they can meet and talk to in person.
  There’s already a bunch of backlash from real estate agents who feel that Zillow is now trying to cut them out of transactions.  Keep in mind, Zillow’s main source of income is selling real estate agents buyer leads.  If too many agents get upset about this, Zillow may feel pressured to discontinue the service.
  Even if they do allow at some point local area investors to be one of the 15 bidders, these will never be good deals for us.  If we are competing against 14 other investors, we will never get a good enough price to buy - someone is always willing to overpay.
  The prospecting methods that we utilize will always allow us to get to sellers first and will always work to get great deals.  If Zillow is successful, they will only get a fraction of the total motivated seller market share.


Overall, on the whole, I would project this to be a complete non-event for us, BUT as with everything else it is something to always keep an eye on.  Things are always changing and we are always keeping an eye out for anything that may impact our or your investment business.

Here is the article that was released yesterday in case you want further details:

Today, Zillow launched a pilot program in two cities — Las Vegas and Orlando, Florida — called “Zillow Instant Offers,” with the promise that a home sale transaction can be completed in as little as a week.

The new Zillow product allows prospective homesellers to receive all-cash offers from a hand-selected group of 15 large private investors along with a side-by-side comparative market analysis (CMA) from a local Zillow Premier Agent.

Zillow Instant Offers mobile view.

Homesellers who accept one of the offers are encouraged by Zillow to use an agent in the process, but they are not required to do so.

Once offers are received from participating investors, the homeowner can choose one of three options:


  Accept an offer and sell directly to an investor
  Accept an offer and use an agent to manage and close the transaction
  Reject the offers and list the property on the MLS with an agent


The initiative promises a more streamlined and friction-free transaction, managed by Zillow-owned dotloop, and a process that may give the seller more certainty.

Zillow is leveraging its consumer brand and distribution to offer a radical new business model for homesellers first pioneered by Opendoor and gaining favor with investors and homesellers in test markets.

Even though it is a two-market test, and Zillow will collect no money from the test, the move may jolt some in the real estate industry who are suspicious of Zillow’s every move.

How it works

Homeowners participating in the Instant Offers program take the following steps:


  Sellers can sign up their home for Instant Offers by providing several photos of the home and filling out key information about the property, including home type, bedrooms, features, roof type, flooring, any major remodels, painting history, age of appliances, HOA status and any other important disclosures.
  The home description then goes to the 15 Wall Street investors, who are either licensed as brokers or use a third-party broker license, and the property details also get sent to participating Zillow Premier Agents, who will be asked to submit a CMA. Investors and agents have 24 hours to submit an offer, and their offers expire in five days.

        <description>

Cold calling is the tried and true method for finding motivated sellers. It’s not the most fun thing in the world, but it flat-out works. However, there are few things you need to keep in mind to cold call effectively, or you might end up giving up far too easily.

First, make sure that you load your phone records into a dialer when calling. We recommend a dialer called Mojo Dialer. For $150 a month, you can make between 500 and 700 calls per day. The benefit of this kind of software is that it prevents wasting time; you dial from one person to the next with no pause. If it goes to voicemail, you just click a button to leave a message rather than saying the same thing over and over again.

“A dialer prevents wasted time.”

The second important thing to be sure of is that you’re dialing the right people. You want to call motivated sellers that make sense to call. Two groups that I like are people in a notice of default situation or absentee owners that don’t live at the house in question.

The next most important aspect is to make sure you have the right phone numbers. You also need to get cell phone records. Home records work, but cell phone records will get calls picked up three times more on average. With good phone numbers, you’ll get a higher contact rate. A good contact rate to shoot for is 10%, meaning you actually talk to 10% of all the people that you dial. A contact rate of 3% means you don’t have good phone numbers.

With a dialer and good phone numbers, you’ll find that cold calling is a very useful way to generate motivated sellers. If you want to get more details on exactly how we do this, check out my training at www.realestateinvestingiseasy.com. If you have any other questions, you can always call or email me. I’m happy to help.

When did you join Cameron Real Estate Group?

January 3rd, 2017.

Where did you work before coming to Cameron?

I used to own two RE/MAXs and I also worked at Keller Williams and I’ve had my own brokerages.

What was life/business like before making the decision to work with Cameron? What were you up to, how was it different?

I would say more hectic, out of control, not focused.

Were you unsure and/or skeptical before deciding to work at Cameron? What were you unsure about?

They made some pretty big promises so I thought they were blowing smoke. They recruited me for over a year and I just didn’t believe their pitch but they’ve actually over-produced **from what they told me they were going to do.

What was it specifically that ultimately helped you make the decision to join Cameron?

Well once I met with Nicole and I met with Tom I felt a little more comfortable with what they were telling me. They showed me some of systems that they were using. And like I said, they’ve done more than they said they were going to do, and I expected a lot less to be honest with you.
##
What benefits have you received since making the decision to work with Tom? How is life or business different?

My appointments have been scheduled for me. I’ve already put under agreement in the first four months more commissions than I made all of last year, strictly through Tom, not even my own business.

Tom always tells everyone he has tons of leads and most agents think it is too good to be true. What would you say about that?

I hope none of them believe him because I’ll take all the leads that they don’t get.

What would you say to someone who is on the fence about choosing to join Cameron?

I wished I’d joined a year and a half ago. I am also a broker in Massachusetts and New Hampshire so I don’t need to work with an office or an agency, I can run my own business. And with Tom, what he’s offering, it’s really a no-brainer, there’s no reason for me to work for myself. Tom’s been incredible with his resources and he takes advice and he runs with it. I‘d say he’s the best owner I’ve ever worked with. Including myself, I’m not as good as Tom, I said it!

One of the biggest mistakes that almost every new investor makes when it comes to building a cash buyer list is trying to compile one right away.

Most new investors think they need a cash buyer list on day one before they go out marketing for properties. Every week, someone calls me and says, “I know that you buy a ton of homes in the area; can I get a list of your criteria?”

Here is the secret: If you find a real investor who buys more than 100 homes a year in the area like we do in Boston, then that investor does not have criteria. A real investor will buy anything that makes money.

On day one, the last thing you want to worry about is building a cash buyer list. Instead, go out, find a great deal, and then market that deal to the biggest investors in your market.

“A real investor will buy anything that makes money.”

Our current market makes it incredibly easy to wholesale a deal, so don’t worry about criteria. Figure out what kind of property you want to market first, then get a deal under contract and find the cash buyer. In today’s market, if you can’t wholesale a deal within 48 hours of getting it under contract, then it’s not a deal.

There are a couple of things you can do to wholesale that deal and find those big investors:


  Go to the local auction. There you will find some of the biggest players in our market. All of those investors are willing to put up nonrefundable money for properties they haven’t gotten a chance to get into.
  Google “Sell Your House Fast” in the city that you have the contract in. Whichever investor is paying for Google AdWords is a seriously motivated cash buyer. You just need a few of them to wholesale a deal.


You can also go to a website like BiggerPockets or post the home in a Facebook group for the town or area the property is in.

If you do these four things and you don’t get multiple bids in 48 hours, then you need to back out because it’s not a deal.

If you have any other questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

What would you like other agents to know about Tom Cafarella?

If you work for Tom there are no limits. I believe that what you put into it is what you get back out of it when you work for him. He is a brilliant, young entrepreneur who really creates a lot of opportunities for his agents and investors so whatever you’re willing to put in, he’s got plenty of opportunities to give back. That’s how I feel about it.

What has been your experience working on his team?



It’s a good one. I’m not real close to their office, I’m a little far way. But it is a big, warm welcome family so I feel as if I can reach out and there’s always somebody there at almost any time, whether I needed some help, virtually in any sort of way there’s always someone to reach out to with the team.  So it really doesn’t matter where I’m located.

How is Tom different?

I think that he’s looking at real estate, not as a crowded, in other words over-saturated, real estate can seem over-saturated. A lot of people don’t want to get into it because it’s over-saturated. It doesn’t matter to him because there’s still room for another entrepreneur to create many different opportunities in a different way with different thinking. And I think that’s what he’s come across. So it doesn’t matter what else is out there, there can still be more but in a different way, his way.

Is there anything else you’d like to share?

I really do think the best way to create your future in this is to create it.  And he has allowed everybody an opportunity with his tools to create what it is they are looking for.

If you followed steps one and two of the most important things to do in order to make money as a real estate investor, you’ve generated motivated seller leads and gone on appointments with a seller. You’ve built a rapport with them, and now they want to work with you.

The only thing left to figure out is how you will personally make money on that deal. There are 4 ways to do so:


  Fix and flip: Fixing and flipping a property generally provides the highest profit of all four exit strategies. You’ll want to cherry pick which deals you want to do and which deals you don’t want to do.
  Wholesale: These will be the deals that, for whatever reason, you don’t want to fix and flip. There’s never been a better market than today to wholesale a property. Investors are out there fighting amongst themselves and competing over deals with each other. One of the best methods to wholesale is to go to your local auction with a flyer of the property you’re trying to sell and hand it out. Anyone attending an auction is highly motivated to buy a property, and this is one of the best ways to build a cash buyer list.
  Buy and hold: By this I mean add that property into your rental property portfolio.
  List the property: If you’re a licensed agent, you can do this yourself. If not, you can reach out to another agent. Why would I recommend that someone list their property? Let’s say you have a property worth $200,000 in its current condition, the seller for it owes $180,000, and your investment offer was $150,000. This deal fits into the niche of not being a good enough price to be an acquisition and not being a short sale option because the seller has equity built into it. At the end of the day, it can only be a listing deal.


“The only thing left to figure out is how you will personally make money on the deal.”

Well when I first started with him there were only a few agents and he grew incredibly fast. During that time he always maintained trying to build it in the best way possible or not upsetting anyone on his team. He would always send out emails describing different thoughts or ideas that he had to move the business forward. So he always asked his team agents what their thoughts are, after he receives any feedback he then moves forward and implements a plan that will hopefully benefit all and grow the business or everyone’s business.


How is Tom different?

Tom is different, Tom is amazing. Being a business owner myself when I had a restaurant/deli/sandwich shop I know all the hard work that is involved with building one from scratch. Out of all of the business owners I’ve met, and I can truly honestly say this, he’s the most hard working business person that I know. And besides being hard working, is very fair and cares about others. He’s just incredible for all that he does. How he presents himself all the time, he never gets upset, at least not out in front of anyone, and he’s just an amazing person to watch and follow, to grow and him being a mentor, anything along those lines. He’s just an extremely bright person and definitely has a strong direction on where he wants to go with his goals and is laser focused on getting there.

Is there anything else you’d like to share?

I guess if I had a chance of picking an up-and-coming superstar in the business real estate world, I would definitely choose Tom Cafarella as being that number one person for what’s going on right now in the world of real estate. That’s what I would add, you’ll definitely be seeing and hearing more of him in a good way.

What would you like other agents to know about Tom Cafarella?

“Definitely a great guy. He stands behind his work, if he says he’s going to do something he’ll definitely follow through, so that’s been good. As far as an agent/broker type relationship, he’s a real supportive guy.”

What has been your experience working on his team?

“It’s been excellent. I’ve known Tom a little while, he invited me to come join his team a little while back and at first I said no, I’m not interested, I’m comfortable where I am. But when I did move over to his office, I was just completely surprised at how he’s doing things. He’s on the up-swing of his career, he’s got momentum going his way, with what he’s building. So I’m happy to be a part of it.”

How is Tom different?

“I’d say he’s forward-thinking and he’s creative. He wants to grow, and part of growing is solving problems so he’s a good problem solver. He wants to make it easier for his agents to be successful and to do business. Where some of the other agencies kind of throw a bunch of road blocks and BS when all you’re trying to do is sell real estate and get on with the rest of your life. So, I think that’s most important, he makes things easy.”

Is there anything else you’d like to share?

“Overall I’ve enjoyed working with him, he’s definitely been support to me. I’ve been in the business for a long time, but any new agent, and this is what I’ve been telling people while I’m out there talking to other people, any new agent that’s looking to get some momentum behind their business or wants to learn what it’s all about, wants to learn what the business is all about, and it’s more than just selling homes, it’s about lead generation and creating business for yourself, finding buyers, finding sellers. Working with Tom and his team and everybody that’s behind him, they’ll definitely get that advantage. To see what it’s all about and to see how to grow a REAL real estate business for yourself. That’s the truth, he’s doing a lot that a lot of other agencies in the area just aren’t doing. I’ll say that, but every other agent that’s been working with him over the last six months or year, they’ll all agree to it. He’s a good guy.”

In my last video, I stressed the importance of generating motivated seller appointments. Once you’ve generated that appointment, you’re 90% of the way there.

Now you’ve actually got to go on the appointment and do everything in your power to have the best one possible. Most investors think the most important part is the pre-appointment analysis and prep in figuring out what your offer is going to be. That couldn’t be further from the truth.

The most important thing when it comes to having a successful seller appointment is building a great rapport with the seller and providing them with solutions to their needs. What you’re offering is irrelevant. You need to go to the appointment, get the seller to like you, and build a bond with them. It’s not much more complicated than that. You want to understand what they need and how you can provide them with a solution that meets those needs.

“Understanding their needs will help you provide a solution.”

In a lot of cases, you might not be the correct solution for that seller. Your job is to help the seller determine what the right solution is and help them get there. That’s what will make you a ton of money in this business.

        <title>What is Wholesaling & How Do You Do It?</title>

        <description>A wholesaler is simply someone who goes out and secures real estate at below market cost and sells their interest to the general public at wholesale prices.

When wholesaling a property, you always need to end up make the decision on the mechanics of how you are going to wholesale it.  There are two options to wholesale a deal: assignment of contract and double closing.

There are plusses and minuses to each of these options and specific scenarios where it makes sense to do one over the other and this article will give you all that you need to know.

What is an assignment?

With an assignment, the buyer takes your place in the contract. The original contract that you have with the seller that has your name with “and/or assigns” as the buyer.

You should always sign the initial agreement with your name and or/assigns regardless of whether you are going to wholesale the contract because even if you are not wholesaling the contract, you will want to have the ability to close in any entity of your choosing(in my cases we have a few different entities that we buy in.

You then would sign a completely separate agreement with your buyer(the investor who is going to actually close on the deal), which specifies how much your assignment fee.  For example, if you put a property under contract for $150,000 and the end buyer is going to pay $160,000, you need to have a separate assignment contract that states that this buyer agrees to pay you $10,000 in order to “buy” your contract which allows them to pay $150,000 for the property.

Plusses of assigning


  No closing costs
  You know exactly how much you are making


Minuses of assigning

Investment buyer sees what you are paying.  If the assignment fee is large enough, it is common that an investor will try to negotiate you down more on the price.

Unfortunately, some of this is human nature.  If the investment buyer sees that you are making $30,000 on the assignment, they may feel that you shouldn’t make that much when all that you did was find the deal(when they have to put up the money and manage the project).  Whether this is true or not is irrelevant…you just need to know that it happens all the time.

What is a double close

With a double closing, you sign a contract with the seller, and then you sign a separate contract between you and the buyer with the same closing date as the first contract.   In this case you have two contracts: one contract with you as the buyer and one contract with you as the seller.  You will pay closing costs when you buy it, and you will pay closing costs when you sell it. Many times, the seller will not know that you are reselling it and will not know how much or to who you are selling it to. The same is true for your buyer. A double closing has more anonymity and privacy, but you will pay for it with closing costs.

Pluses of double closing


  Investment buyer does not see what you are paying


Minuses of double closing


  It costs more.  You need to pay closing costs such as attorney fees, transfer taxes,
  You have to find an attorney that will do it - which is not a huge challenge but some won’t do this kind of transaction


When it generally makes sense to assign


  When you know and fully trust the investor buying the deal.  I buy a ton of assignment contracts myself every single year and the wholesalers who work with me know that I don’t care what they make on a deal and I won’t try to squeeze them if I know they are making a ton of money on a deal.  The reality is that if you are unsure if you trust the investor enough, you don’t want to take any chances.
  When you are making a small spread.  There is no hard and fast rule about what this is, but, for example, if you are only making $3,000 on the assignment, you would literally lose money double closing so you would NEED to assign it to make any money
  In my personal opinion, I will double close on any deal that I make $15,000 or more on UNLESS I know the end buyer very well and in that case I will assign regardless of the profit in the deal


When it generally makes sense to double close


  When you are making a lot of money on the wholesale
  If for some reason it is important to you to not have the end buyer find out what you are paying


You don’t want to get bogged down into the details of the above UNTIL YOU HAVE A DEAL UNDER CONTRACT.

At the end of the day, if you have a great deal, figuring out the mechanics are the easy part.  If the deal is bad, you could know the mechanics inside and out and it wouldn’t matter.

If you want to become a real estate investor, the first step is the most important one in the process. It’s the only one that matters.

The first step is to get one-on-one with motivated sellers to make them offers.

In today’s market, once a property goes online and you have 10 to 20 investors competing for it, you won’t get a great deal on it anymore. In fact, there are people out there doing deals for little to no margins at all. As a real estate investor, you don’t want to compete against that.

You want to create your own leads and your own deals that you’re the only one in on.

“You want to create your own leads and deals that only you are in on.”

That’s why I’d caution you not to run out and get a website or business cards and stationery or any of the little things that won’t put any money in your pocket. Sellers don’t care about your business cards! Don’t do all the small things like buying business cards or reading yet another real estate investing book because you might not ever get an appointment or a deal.

The bottom line is to make getting the appointment your No. 1 priority. Once you get one-on-one with enough sellers, it almost doesn’t matter whether you have a nice website and brochure—you will make money.

If you want to learn more about the marketing methods that work really well for me in my business, I encourage you to visit www.realestateinvestingiseasy.com.

If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be more than happy to help!

What was life/business like before making the decision to work with Tom’s team?

“A little less busy, but none the less, I didn’t know this opportunity existed, to be honest.”

Were you unsure and/or skeptical before deciding to work with Tom? If so, what were you unsure about?

“Well I definitely was unsure and a little skeptical because I’ve made deals in marketing and other types of things that have really messed me over and so that kind of was the initial insecurity. But when I got to talking to Tom and just him as a person kind of being in the same position as I am it really helped me to make that decision.”

What was it specifically that ultimately helped you make the decision to go ahead and work with our team?

“Well, Tom was pretty open, and he really showed me that this is something that he’s going to help me out with and he’s proven that.”

How long did it take you to put your first investment deal under contract after working with Tom?

“2 weeks.”

How many seller leads would you estimate that you have received since working with Tom?

“Oh probably about 50.”

What would you say to someone who is on the fence about choosing to work with Tom and his team?

“I think it’s a great opportunity. If you’ve never been involved in real estate investing than working with Tom really helps you to have the materials you need to get ready for that.”

What would you like other agents to know about Tom Cafarella?

“I guess I would like them to know that he is a very fair broker in the process. He certainly treats people fairly in the way that he gives people that work hard the better opportunities to succeed. Certainly in real estate it’s a 100% commission type of role so you have to put a lot of effort in to get stuff out of it. So I feel that he’s fair that for those that treat the job like a full-time job and put in the effort he tries to reward them by giving them company generated leads and I think it’s overall a great place to work.”

What has been your experience working on his team?

“It’s been very good. Everybody I’ve worked with so far has been great to work with. There’s I think 130 agents right now or probably more than that who are within the agency. I’ve met probably 20 or 25 of the newer agents. Another thing that he offers is a training class, a weekly training class to kind of, for someone like me who doesn’t have real estate experience I’ve had the opportunity to kind of learn how to do presentations in front of customers and things like that. I’ve certainly met a lot of agents through that class. It’s a noncompetitive environment even though we’re obviously out to get business in our own way. Certainly the people that I’ve met and worked with they’ve been willing to help each other out and give each other advice, those who’ve been through it before. I think the team’s been great.”


How is Tom different?

“I would say he’s different in the way that he has a different model that a lot of other agencies don’t necessarily do. He works not only on the listing and selling of a property but also on the investment side so he has a branch of the company that basically flips properties. So they look for situations on properties that need updating and renovations, so that gives agents like myself opportunities to meet people that we normally wouldn’t get in contact with. He gives us the opportunity to go to the potential seller of a property and he gives us multiple options as far as how to work with them moving forward. So we can offer them either a cash investment option where they can get a cash offer on the spot and if they’re in dire need to sell their property immediately that sometimes can work out, where they say, look, we just want to sell it today. Also that works pretty well with estate situations where the family might not agree on a price to sell the property and things like that and they might want to avoid any conflict. And if that option doesn’t work you have the opportunity to talk about listing the property and trying to get top dollar. Rather than most companies where you go in and you just have the opportunity to try to list the property he gives you a couple different scenarios that you can present to the client and give them just more things to consider and more things to think about.”

Is there anything else you’d like to share?

“It’s certainly a rapidly growing company. His office is based in Wakefield Mass. which is over 40 miles away from me and there’s actually quite a few agents that do that commute. We could all have the opportunity to work in our own town. There’s obviously real estate companies probably in every town in Mass. if not multiple but a lot of agents choose to do the commute a few times a week. Not every day, but a couple times a week because we feel that there’s better opportunities when we work under this particular agency. I feel that it’s worth doing the hour and half commute once or twice a week to get those leads and get those opportunities you wouldn’t normally get.” f agents choose to do the commute a few times a week. Not every day, but a couple times a week because we feel that there’s better opportunities when we work under this particular agency.

“Tom, it has been awesome working with you, learning something new everyday.  My life before working with you was boring, frustrating, and trying to get started in a new market is very difficult. Now I have plenty of leads, and I have support to call if I need it!!  I was very unsure  and very skeptical about working with you, the only thing I new was that you were from Massachusetts and that is where I am from, and I was trying figure out if you were the Real Deal.  What helped me decide to join you was checking out your real estate website and calling one of your agents and asking her all about you, and what  she thought of your company, and she said you were the Real Deal!!!  The benefits of joining you are that I have purpose to get up, get dressed and get moving everyday!! My life and business are better for it, I have been with you just over a month and half, I have 2 listed and 2 under contract :)  I have investors wanting to work with me. I would recommend anyone that is willing work and wants to learn more about how you do business, and if anyone is on the fence about joining you, have them call me. I will tell you Tom is the Real Deal, and whatever he says he is going to do, he does it. Man of his word!!!”

Thank you Tom,

Mary Cain, Realtor with Carolina Realty of the Low Country

When it comes to your career, you must love what you do. Why?

To give you some insight, let me tell you about how I got into the real estate industry. Growing up, my grandfather was a very successful landlord, and I knew from a very young age that I wanted to be a real estate investor as well. The funny thing is, even though he was financially successful, everyone discouraged me from following in his footsteps. They advised me instead to get a more traditional nine-to-five job in terms of my own career path.

I ended up taking their advice and becoming an accountant. I started as a CPA working at a CPA firm, but I knew from day one that job was a mistake. Because everyone kept pushing me, though, I kept plugging along. Every day I’d sit at my desk and read and daydream about real estate investing. It got to a point where I was having trouble completing my assignments at the firm, and they eventually fired me.

“Do what you love.”

Nobody likes to be fired, and at that time I didn’t know what a blessing it was. For the next two or three weeks, I didn’t know what I was going to do. Then, it hit me—I knew I should follow my passion and give real estate investing a try. The rest is history.

Now I wake up every single day loving going to work and putting in hours. The bottom line is this: If you’re not happy with the work that you do, you’re never going to be great at it. When it comes to making money, you only make a lot of it if you’re really good at what you do. You’ll only be really good at what you do if you’re passionate about it.

Don’t be like me and wait until you get fired to follow your passion. We’re only around for a limited period of time, so get started today and be happy about waking up and going to work.

Did Ocean City Development do what they said they were going to do when they were going to do it?

“Yes they did.”

Did everything go smoothly?

“Yes, yes it did.”

What was the main reason that you decided to sell to Ocean City Development?

“I decided to sell the house so I had several people look at it. Barbara who came in and looked, she went through it and she gave me a pretty good offer up front and then I talked to her later and I got a little bit better offer and that was the agreement I wanted to go with. I felt she was very professional. I was pretty comfortable. I wanted to deal with you guys rather than another company just because I felt that you were a lot more professional than the other companies I dealt with, and I did deal with several.“

Did you feel like they were helpful throughout the process and did you feel that you were treated fairly?

“Yes.”

In the end, were you happy that you ended up selling to them and would you recommend another seller in a similar situation do the same?

“Yes to both questions.“

Did everything go smoothly when you worked with Ocean City Development?

“Yes, and I worked with Katie Blair I believe her name was, she was the Realtor that I originally dealt with and she was fantastic, I mean terrific, professional but compassionate.  Very nice person, and Tom was very nice. Every time I called him and left him a message he’d call me right back.”

What was the main reason that you decided to sell to Ocean City Development?

“The reason I sold to Ocean was, I only had two, I had once come up and we couldn’t agree on price. And Ocean City came, they gave me a price, I thought it was a fair price for the condition of the house and I went with Ocean City. And I had no idea of how they were going to be to deal with but they were fantastic, I had no problems.”

Do you feel like your were treated fairly and they were helpful throughout the entire process?

“Yes they were.”

In the end, were you happy that you ended up selling to them and would you recommend another seller in a similar situation do the same?

“I definitely would, they were very fair with me.”

“You know he’s different than most brokers because he’s willing to share his knowledge and he’s not a typical broker in that he doesn’t do deals himself, he’s always looking to help his agents. My experience has been very good, everybody is very helpful, everybody’s out for the best for the company. Tom’s different in that he is very rare in that he does share the knowledge that made him successful with his agents which is something that most people hide from their agents. He actually shares it with them. Cameron is not a traditional real estate company it definitely makes you think outside the box, there’s so many ways to make money besides traditional real estate. To me it’s just you know ten times better than a traditional real estate company.”

There are three simple things I did to help me double my transactions year over year, which are easy to replicate.

These systems happened by accident and out of necessity for me to work fewer hours. As a brief backstory, I’ll tell you that when my daughter was born, I was working between 80 and 100 hours per week. My wife told me that things had to change.

I wasn’t looking to make more transactions at the time, but rather get myself down to 40 hours per week so that I could spend more time with my daughter. I hired three key people in my real estate business: an inside sales agent to make all of my outbound calls and book appointments, an agent to take all of my appointments, and an administrative assistant for the paperwork and backend compliance matters.

“By cutting my hours in half, I doubled my transactions.”

What I quickly realized was that by leveraging my time and allowing myself to focus on lead generation only, I doubled my transactions year over year. Because it worked so well, I decided to implement it across my real estate team. Every agent that’s on my team has leads generated for them and gets the backend taken care of by the administrative assistant, allowing them to do what they do best - work with buyers and sellers.

If you want to learn more about working on our team, give me a call or send me a text. I’d really love to hear from you.

One question I get asked all the time is, “What is the best seller lead generation strategy in today’s market?” It all boils down to this: do you want to spend time generating seller leads, or do you want to spend money generating seller leads?

Let’s assume that you have your marketing budget and you want to spend money on leads, not time. I recommend working with a company called Bold Leads. Bold Leads provides sellers with an online valuation of what their property is worth. The seller will fill out a form, include their email address and home address, and click submit. Then you will get that lead.

These leads run anywhere from $50 to $100 per lead. When someone is looking for an estimate of what their property is worth, generally, there is a fairly high chance that they will be looking to sell in the near future.

“Door-knocking is the best strategy if you want to spend time generating leads.”

If you don’t want to spend money on leads but you do want to spend time, the best marketing method is door-knocking. Target exactly who you want to work with. Have your script and handouts ready to go. We have generated a ton of leads with this method in the markets where we want to buy and list property.

If you don’t have money or time to generate seller leads but you still want seller appointments, give me a call or shoot me a text at 781-918-8800. We generate over 100 seller leads each month and send our agents out directly to those appointments.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I would be happy to help you!

“He gives referrals, which is good. Better than most other agencies do. He’s a man of his word, he does what he says he’s going to do and I enjoy working with him. Slowly becoming a team of quality, but I think it hasn’t reached its peak yet. There’s no hidden cost, he does what he says he’s going to do, and he helps you. He’ll give you advice and you can meet with him and he’ll help you.”

“Tom is like easy going and available for, you know, information, questions, and guidance. It’s fabulous, it’s like the best thing that ever happened to my career. And I’m not exaggerating. One thing that’s different is that he, often at other brokerages they say that the owner and/or managing broker isn’t taking listings but really they are, and he is not. He does not work as a sales broker. So there’s never anything that would happen, you know, like the boss gets all the good stuff because he does not do any sales as the listing agent or the buying agent. He never does any of that. So that’s not a conflict. It often happens at other brokerages. The other thing I might say about working with Tom, with the company, but with Tom specifically at the company is that he’s just 100% on top of every newest technology and available service. So agents get service, you can get phone calls. Everyone knows that leads are called and appointments are scheduled but also there are mailers, there’s concierge, there’s a la carte services, there’s staging, photography, phone calling, after sales follow up mailers. You don’t see that with any other companies. It’s all provided opportunity, and I’m not saying it’s free, but even when it’s not free it’s like at cost. He’s not profiting off it. You don’t see that at other companies.”

“What he says, what he promises, he delivers. I think he has a totally unusual and new concept for real estate agents. And I think that at this point where you have a lot going on with technology it’s very difficult, unless you’re in a big team, to do well. The way he has the office designed is he has the resources to help you compete with some of those mega teams. It’s been phenomenal, I’ve done extremely well. I’ve had my license for 30 years so I’ve been with some of the major real estate companies. My last place was Keller Williams. I was there for three years, and although they have really good training and resources they actually don’t help you generate leads. They give you ideas and they have theories. What’s great about being at Cameron Real Estate is, they actually just give you leads. You know they help you with the follow up, they help you be competitive. So it’s been a good experience. A lot of these big major companies, their systems are not keeping up with technology and I think that Tom is very forward thinking. I personally have developed, I work my own niche, and he’s been able to help me with that, to develop that and to generate my own leads. So I’m not just relying on leads from Zillow or Trulia or any of those other major search engines, which can be very expensive.”

“So Tom is an excellent investor, he does tons of  deals, he doesn’t take any of the leads for himself, provides plenty of leads for his team and is overall a very knowledgeable person in real estate. He’s pretty awesome, I like working with him.  On his team, I’ve tripled my business a lot due to just some of the flexibility he’s given me. My commission is higher and he’s actually allowed me to start my own team down in Florida so he’s been absolutely phenomenal. A mentor, a trainer, and a great broker in general. Very good at answering questions. He allows us flexibility, he really wants to see us grow. He gives us leads, no other office is going to give you leads. These are actual appointments that you walk out on and there’s a seller who wants to sell their house. I’ll say that he also likes encouraging entrepreneurs which I think is very important, especially in the economical state of America. So it’s good for him to be supporting everyone like that. Not just Realtors but everyone in the real estate business. I’m very, very happy working for him and I’m very thankful for the opportunity that I have to build my team through him.”

Welcome to our real estate video blog. This channel is dedicated to helping you make more money in your real estate career and business.

We’re going to give you a behind-the-scenes look at the systems in my business that allow me to generate more than 1,000 leads a month, fix and flip more than 50 properties a year, and that also allow my agents to double their commissions in the course of one year.

“Get a behind-the-scenes look at our systems!”

We’re also going to take a look at the real estate economy, especially where we are and where we will be, as well as the impending market shift.

I’ve condensed each video down to the vital information that you need to help you grow your real estate business. If you ever want a more in-depth look at our videos, check out www.TomCafarella.com or reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!
